extends MeshInstance3D

## This class can automatically break a mesh and then adds physics to the generated chunks.
## This can be done at loading time (chunk_opt_preload = true)
## or when the method 'smash_the_mesh()' is called.
## Useful for very light geometry that doesn't require too much computation. 
## If performance is an issue it's really advisable to use STMCachedInstance3D.

## a size not too distant from the unit: 1x1x1 size. If you change these conventions too much it could produce
